# Linux DTX Daemon for Surface Books

Linux User-Space Detachment System (DTX) Daemon for the Surface ACPI Driver (and Surface Books).
Currently only the Surface Book 2 is supported, due to lack of driver-support on the Surface Book 1.
This may change in the future.

_Work in progress:_
_This will eventually replace the current python implementation at https://github.com/qzed/linux-surfacegen5-dtx-daemon._
_Until then, please refer to that repo._

Current status:
- In terms of functions, this is now up-to-date with the original python implementation.
Packaging will follow shortly.
